Add the cream cheese and stir until there are no chunks in the mixture. Mix in the shredded Cheddar and Gruyere cheese until sauce is smooth. Add the macaroni and the previously set aside cup of water to the saucepan. Don\u2019t worry if it looks too liquidy; eventually the macaroni will soak up the excess liquid. Stir in the marinara sauce, sun dried tomatoes and pepperoni. Once thoroughly mixed, pour into a 13\u2033x9\u2033 inch pan. Evenly sprinkle breadcrumbs and Parmesan over the baking pan with the macaroni and sauce in it. Stick it in the oven for about 10 minutes to lightly brown the macaroni and allow the breadcrumbs to get crispy. Take out of the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
